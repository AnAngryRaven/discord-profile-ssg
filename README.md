# Discord Profile SSG
A simple static site generator (SSG) that allows you to easily create an informative card based on the look of a Discord profile!

## Usage {WIP}

Information is taken from an assortment of JSON files and image files from the `/public` directory.

Follow the format of each JSON file accordingly, and run `npx next-build`. Your site should be present within the newly created folder labeled `out`!

These files may now be hosted by a web server of your choosing.
